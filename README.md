# Code Indexing

Tools to index java code, and other utilities.

TODO
- We can use the "find usages" feature, but it will put all the code into a single html page, so we can
view it all as a whole. 


## Features

- Grouping by components, grouping by domain. 
- Indexing of code, so we can search everything.
